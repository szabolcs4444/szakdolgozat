Wifi service (IITAP)
WLAN / WIFI service at the General Informatics Department (IITAP)
(More Wifi Services at University: Thread, Eduroam)
Currently available access points at the General Informatics Department:
Iitap (I. EM. At the door of 100 in the passage)
Iitap (I. Em. 103 Laborator at the passage)
IITAP (I. EM. In front of 108 in the corridor)
Iitap (I. Em. 107 / B)
Iitap (ii. Em. 202 in Laboratory)
After connecting, it automatically always switches to the strongest AP ("WiFi Roaming").
Supported protocols: 802.11 / b / g / n
Access to the departmental individual LDAP identifiers, so there is no common shared key, everyone has access to the network individually.
Accesses are logged! Outbound connections are logged, so you can retrieve in case of incident to whom it was with your ID!
The information required for this setting is as follows:
Find out on our device from the available WiFi points IITAP name and then enter the following:
(In some operating systems, the order, appearance may differ.)
Network Authentication: WPA2-Enterprise
Encryption: AES or TKIP
EAP Type: EAP-TTLS
Password check type: priest
Identifier Name: My LDAP ACCOUNT NAME
Anonymous ID: None, let's leave blank
Password: My LDAP ACCOUNT Password
Certificate (ca) check (or import this as a reliable CA).
The EAP-TTLS protocol is not supported by operating systems before MS Windows 8.In a fortunate case, the WLAN interface driver replaces things in the WLAN stack, so EAP-TTLS becomes available for example.Intel and Broadcom interfaces in drivers.In other cases, SecureW2 must be installed.Help to set up Windows 10.
The IP allocation is automatically performed (DHCP), the private internal network address is obtained by the clients, which is the Hera server NAT-OL to the outside world.
For Windows Phone, from Version 8.1, EAP-TTLS supported from version 8.1.Help is available here:

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
NO ACCOUNT-OOM, How can I log in?
For Windows:
1. If you already have a UNIX (LDAP) Account, you must register on Winadmin.iit.uni-miskolc.hu
2. If LDAP ACCOUNT is not yet, you must first request it to be a name conflict.
If the Account has been completed, you will receive a notification from your data in e-mail.
So once again: if there is no LDAP ACCOUNT, it will not be Windows !!
For Linux, in Unix, each individual will automatically get an account that you get on your first laboratory class.If this is not done, or maybe a student coming from elsewhere, contact your system administrator or agree with your practitioner.
I forgot my password.
If you have exercises, you can ask your practice manager to negotiate with your system administrator and pass the new password personally in the next practice.
For Windows:
On the Winadmin.iit.uni-miskolc.hu, selecting the "Forgot Password" menu, after entering the required data, confirmation e-mail arrives at the LDAP email address.Things to do in e-mail.If the quota is full, the e-mail will not arrive.
Linux for Unix:
In consultation time, apply for administrator (locating space and dates on the departmental advertiser because they can change every six months) and ask for a new password.Change the new password as soon as possible!
I do not even know if I have a user account for Linux / Unix systems?
Ask a companion - who can log in - to ask the user name from the LDAP directory.Using the LDAPSEARCH -X -LLL "UID = <username>" or LDAPSEARCH -X -LLL "NEPTUND = <NEPTURE>" commands.
I can not log in to the graphical surface of Linux.
If you can log in on the character surface (console, SSH), it's probably your record quota has passed.Go to a character surface, the quota of ellneague with the quota -v command and if necessary deletes the work set to release space.
How to make a password change?
For Windows:
In the menu that appears after pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL buttons, the password change must be selected.
For Linux / Unix:
After logging in, a command interface must be specified in the Passwd instruction, which asks the new password twice and then the old password (Bind Password :) once.We get a message about a successful password change.
I do not receive mail sent to my iit email address.
There are three reasons for the problem:
The virus filter was found in the mail and therefore disrupted its delivery: there is no option to transmit a virus-containing mail.
Fitted to your mailbox disk quota: Log in and release disk space in your mailbox, delete your mail.
The $ {HOME} /. ProcmailRC or $ {HOME} /. FROM FORWARD files, which has an error: Check the settings or delete the files.
I have other problems with Account.
For Windows:
E-mail should be written to administrators.E-mail address: This e-mail address is protected against speech.To view it you need to enable Javascript.
For UNIX:
Indicate the problem to the administrator This e-mail address is protected against speech.To view it you need to enable Javascript.Email address or ask for help from your practitioner!
Under Linux during work, the system will be inoperable.I can't quit either.
You can stop the graphical interface with Ctrl + Alt + BKSPC keys to restart and re-log in again.To log in to a characteristic character, where you can check your process, stop them (using the Kill command) and check your disc quota.If these measures do not help, indicate the problem of the Practice Manager, the Administrator or Tibor Tibor.
When logging in to Windows, I will give you my name and password, but I can not enter it.Message: "Account is locked."
Too many defective entry attempts have occurred (more than 3), so for security reasons, the system has automatically disabled this Account.Indicate Windows Administrators (this email address is protected against speeches. You must enable JavaScript to view it.)
When logging in to Windows, I will give you my name and password, but I can not enter it.The message is "ACCOUNT is disabled."
The user has engaged in any unauthorized activity, so Account has been disabled.Find Windows Administrators (Imre Mihály or Komor Gergely) to clarify the cause of the ban.
What is the difference between Unix or Linux?
UNIX's first operating systems are one of the source source and not free, can be used on servers.Linux can be used for more new, open and free desktop and server machines.GNU is a project that does not contain the code used in UNIX, but ultimately the manufactured operating system, including programs, is similar.The GNU project uses a Linux kernel, although this was not born under the project, so it is better to use GNU / Linux.So Linux is unix-like but not the same.The UNIX principles also use GNU for countless innovations.The UNIX / Linux, UN * X spell reference to this case no matter which one is because there will be no difference.There are other UNIX-like operating systems that may have been open (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD).
Why do not I run the C / C ++ language copied from another (eg home) Linux?
The C or C ++ language is only portable (platform-independent) in source code.
At this time, the processor's architecture is probably different. Optimized on UNIX / Linux systems to run binary on the CPU instruction set (runs quickly from the program). The solution is to re-translate the source on the current machine. (There may be several different types of machines from your user directory.) Or you actually use platform-independent language than Java. At present, the .NET is in a narrower platform-independent, in some cases in Linux. You may use script languages ​​that are platform-independent. Such is Perl, Python, and much more. And your home machine has been set for multiplatform (multiplatform) translation. This also uses that a home translated program will be able to be used, but you can not run at home at home. Also, if your processor supports and has more partitions, you can install distribution for several different architectures. And X86 (I386, ..., I868) and X86_64 (AMD64) architectures can also be treated by emulators. You may miss a shared library (dynamic coupling library) that would be loaded during the run.
Why can not I run the C / C ++ language copied from the Windows machine?
The C or C ++ language is only portable (platform-independent) in source code.Solution, recompiling on different types of machines.Some libraries are not platform-independent, so they can not be translated.Solution Optional and remove these functions from the source code.Replacing platform-dependent functions with ANSI C or GNULIB functions.(Not always possible. Using the C language macros is conditional for platform-dependent translation.) In some cases, you can run with the Wine program (Wine file name or file name.exe) - if installed.(You can also turn Windows binares on your Linux.)
Why are you almost more than one program?
Though they were written for the same task, different principles and solutions are used to use libraries, so they have different resources (processor, memory) requirements and other user interfaces.Thus, users of different thinking modes can use what they do.It may not be installed, then it can be solved with the other.
I'm using Debian GNU / Linux, but why is it different from this?
The administrator produces and can customize the entire system based on your ideas, so even the same distribution may vary greatly.(Safety, reliability can be more important than comfort.)
I do not use Debian GNU / Linux, do I benefit or disadvantage?
There will be no big difference between programs (possibly due to different versions).Debian's stable versions are best-tested programs, so most programs are different (lagging) to most programs compared to other distributions.Because of the principle of backward compatibility, which works Debian, it will also be newer, more likely to fail.So, which worked at home, it is most likely - since it is rarely needed in the mainly command line, it will work on new solutions.Among the distributions, it is most important to differ in administrator activities.Listen to the fact that different machines can run a different version of Debiant.To query this, the LSB_REASASE command can be used.
I only have Windows-om how can I practice on Linux?
With Putty, you can enter the servers so you can run a command line or graphics program.Instead of Putty, you can use Java applets (applet):
You can install only bash shell, named Cygwin.
You can use emulator and install Linux.
If you can create a new partition (s), you can also install it (either from Windows or Pendrive and CD / DVD).
You can also run Linux from a pendrive (over 4GB) or CD / DVD although it is so slower.
To access the descriptions of the commands, the Internet also has sufficient number of pages that contain documentation converted to HTML format.
Why are there any defective file names in compressed file names?
Why don't you unpack the compressed file?
Some graphics packers do not happen to accented files (if not using the default character encoding), this is not a problem at the command line.
Why are file names in meaningless characters?
Check during login, the language setting and its character encoding.Or subsequently set it up properly.This was incorrectly defective encoding filenames, different from default (just used).Look for a character encoding or change the code page during the publication.
Krusader: "Publication" menu item "Remote Character Selection"
Browser:
IceWeaSel / Firefox: "View" menu item "Character encoding"
Apache setting: can't be :-(
Languages, more specifically between different character encoding, if we use not only ASCII characters to be used here.If you do so, you can convert to the Convmv command, eg:
Convmv -notest -f Latin2 -t UTF-8 filename.
Why do text files contain meaningless characters?
At this time, it was incorrectly entered encoding the contents of the hurts, different from default.Look for a character encoding or change the code page during the publication.
Browsers: Iceweasel (Firefox): "View" menu item "Character encoding"
Apache setting :-(
The Recode command can be converted, eg RECODE LATIN2 .. File name.(I used to use ICONV
volt.)
Why do they contain nonsense characters at the end of the queues of text files?
Not the same Terminal Encoding is used for different types of systems.Save or even during display Most word editors are able to convert.With RECODE, you can convert, eg RECODE LATIN2 / CR-LF .. or RECODE MACCE / CR .. etc.This can cause problems with certain files, eg configuration files, some instructions for script files!Always always a blank line closes configuration or script files.
Why does not your computer find out the character encoding?
Programs read bytes or send to the screen.So it is irrelevant to what character to people.If it is known that the file is written in human, non-programming language, the character encoding can be easily assigned, but it must first recognize this meaningful content.Countries and languages in Western Europe (American English): IBM-850, ISO 8859-1, Windows-1252 or more ISO 8859-15, but Finnish only ISO-8859-15;Celtic (Irish, Welszi, etc.) Language: ISO 8859-14;In Eastern Europe: IBM-852, ISO 8859-2, Windows-1250 or Southeast Europe: ISO-8859-16 can be used.The Hungarian language belongs to both, although printing quotation marks, only the latter is and the big bonnet is still in this.
Can I enter multiple machines at the same time?
Yes, but as stated in the Code - in justified cases and not instead of.
Can you log on to a machine several times or more?
Graphic interface is not the same user, but another yes.A character surface or remotely.
No sound, what do I do?
Alsamixer, one with one of AUMIX programs, make sure that the sound card mixer is not overwhelmed.
I do not see some multimedia content on websites why?
Flash Player is installed so it must be good.For the Firefox / Iceweasel browser, Moonlight is not, so you need to add it (install).
In a strange way, I can see some web pages, why?
Unfortunately, this even if IceWeaSel browser does not support the page.At this time, we must lie on the browser and even the identity of the system.Solution: Find "User Agent" Setup and enter the expected browser data.Firefox / IceWeaSel: Write in the "URL location" box About: Config, and then look for the General.useragent.extra.firefox key and change the value.
Why is wet not (same) downloading like a graphic browser?
Yes You may like this, enter your browser ID:
wget --user-agent=Firefox/3.6
UTF-8 or ISO 5589-2 (Latin2)?
It depends on what you need if you have enough Latin2 encoding 255 signals then use.However, if there are more than THF-8.(Most programs aresupported, but not allsuch.:tr)(Available inseveralHungarianpunctuation andneitheristhe eurosymbol ifLatin2,does not includethem.)If you useonlyEnglish(Latin)alphabetand punctuationsigns, it isirrelevantto theencodingtype.(However, in addition to the UTF-8 character encoding, no other Unicode (UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32) standard is not the case.)
Why does not the CD drive open?
Before opening, the attached CD or DVD must always be disconnected!
Attach Umount / Cdrom, Umount / Media / Cdrom or Umount / Dev / Sr0 commands, then try to remove it.Also, with the EJECT command, you can close or close the drive tray, then UMOUNT is unnecessary.(When using the Audio CD and DVD movie (playback) No Mount and Umount Command No.) IceWeaSel / Firefox is "good day", not the usual pages are loaded.This is due to the operating system setting, the web content of the web content is loaded on the names of the university server.
Why, I can not format the file system of the pendrive or other device?
Only the administrator is entitled to do so.If the file system is not damaged by the CHMOD -R 700 directory;RM -R library is enough.Listen to this directory deletes complete content!In this case, ignore the replacement characters (?, *, []) (Chmod A + W is required if we do not have a write right to the library, Windows viruses are mostly created.)
Which shell shell should I use?
Whichever oneyou like, buttheBourneAgainShellfirstiseducation.This counts the most common and most popular.The Gold and Jerry machine logs from home without a password, but if you enter one of the other, you will be asked again.
Yes With current settings, password transmission is not allowed.Thus, these machines must also place the private key, but close attention to the correct entitlement.
How can I stop (can I close) my processes?
How do I check that I do not run unnecessarily my process?
You can retrieve the PS -UWX, PS AWUX, PS -ef, PSTREE -P, or Top commands for what processes run.The unnecessary is what you think.You can set the Killall program name or Kill -s Sigkill PID command.
What do you use Pendrive or other removable device?
The LSOF or Fuser command shows you what they are.These can be locked or even a library shift is sufficient.
Why don't Killall work?
Yes Sometimes it doesn't work properly.Then enter the name specified by the PS -WX or Top command or set it to Kill -s Sigkill PID.
The file systemfiles inZIParchivespacked, butweirdcharactershave beenextracted toWindowsfilenames.
At this time, Presumably UTF-8 encoded files have been compressed.Easiest to enable coding of file names on Linux to encode the FAT file system properly and then compress this and then out.
I'm a left guarantee how can I have the mouse over?
Graphic interface from command line:
three buttons (old classic) mouse: xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"
three-button roller (most widespread) mouse: xmodmap -e "pointer = 4 5 3 2 1" (there is such a lab)
Five button roller mouse: xmodmap -e "pointer = 5 6 3 4 5 2 1"
And in some window managers include such an option (in control panel).
English Keyboard allocation, how can be Hungarian?
Graphic interface from command line:
With the SETXKBMAP EN.
And in some window managers include such an option (in control panel).The login screen will not affect the setting.
Certify some commands at each login, how can I automate these?
How can I start automatically command (program)?
Command line: .bashrc
X window: .xsession
Which configuration file is what?
Certain commands at certain intervals, how can I automate these?
Because, there is no crontab, or a command, so only with the SLEEP command or endless cycle.
I want to use a decimal point instead of decimal suppression on the numeric keyboard.
Graphic interface from command line:
xmodmap -e 'keycode 91 = period'
Restore:
xmodmap -e 'keycode 91 = comma'
How to back up your own media?
How to copy files?
SSH: SSH Server Cat Tavoli_fre> Local_File or SSH server "TAR -CJF - Tavoli_konyvtar"> Local.bz2
SCP: A recursive copying may be a problem.Symbolic links will be removed first.If you do not do the copying you can never end because the links can be a loop and do the disc.The remote machine we went to: Find ~ -Type l -fprintf ~ / symlinks.lst "% l \ 0% p \ 0" -exec rm \ {\} \;Then Copying from the Local Machine SCP -R This e-mail address is protected against speech.To view it you need to enable JavaScript.: ~ ~ / IDE when you are ready for your local and remote machine: Cat ~ / symlinks.lst |XARGS -0N2 LN -S && RM ~ / SYMLINKS.LST
SFTP: Get tavoli_fjli_fajli helyi_fjle
FTP: Get tavoli_fjli_fajli helyi_flja
RSync: Rsync -avz -e ssh server: Konyvtar local_konyvtar
Sshfs: sshfs server: Konyvtar Battery_point;Fusermount -u battlefield
Featured my storage space What do I do?
Several programs also use cache, so you can drain or disable them in the application settings.If you have a graphical interface or sign-in and canceled, some configuration files are written from the memory again to the file system despite the deletion.If you want to delete everything, sign up on the graphical interface and log in to the character interface or remotely use SSH or SFTP protocol programming programs and delete them through these.
How do you do not log on to the graphics, ie character interface?
Ctrl + Alt + F1 can switch to Ctrl + Alt + F7 for graphically, and Ctrl is not mandatory.The operating system messages are displayed on this screen, so it is more advantageous to use Ctrl + Alt + F2 and Ctrl + Alt + F6.
How to save with the repository?
If the same file has several times, it can be created by hardcutting (hardlink), eg if the contents of the public_html can be found in our other library, one can remove and even have the upgrade to be addressed. This can not be used for directory names and not for files on the same file system. They can be used for these simplex links, but the number of files that can be created will decrease and smaller measured storage. The running binary can be compacted, then can be used in the same way, but they are replaced by less, but they can start slower. This is gzexe, bzexe, upx. If we reverse the optimization do not go to the file size increase, access to the GCC -O2 and GCC -O1 commands. Use script files instead of reverse and running languages, although they run slower but there will be no two separate files (source code and binary). All files tömöríthettük tar, tar format only reduces the numbers of files, not the storage. Using TAR.GZ (TAR -CVZF) or TAR.BZ2 (TAR -CVJF) format, all are available. Here you can move our files between / TMP and $ HOME - either in and out of it. Perhaps source codes can also be written in a row, so we have each row to win a byte. To do this, write your own script. The indent command can already be used for viewing. Because the default adjustment files are automatically created, just the difference (what we added) is enough. This method can also be used when multiple versions of source codes are left. The library is also a file, so by creating libraries, the number of files that can be created will decrease. We can remove blank files, libraries, defective (orphan) links. Find -Depth -Type f -empty -exec RM \ {\} \; -or -the d-dempty -exec rmdir \ {\} \; -or -follow -the l
Remove unnecessary files: DVI O etc.
I set up my own user interface, can I copy this to anyone else?
In many cases - mainly window drag settings - copying files is not a solution.Whatever achievement
It contains a route (s), so they all need to be edited.
I have set up my own user interface at home, can I copy this to another machine?
In many cases, copying files is not a solution.It contains a full path (s), so they all need to be edited.The username match is still small because user directory can be the / home / group / user name, / users / username, etc.as well.Othon is presumably under the / home / ophasy name.And check that the two programs are matched or nearly the same version.
How can I create your own web page?
With the mkdir -m 555 ~ / PUBLIC_HTML command, a suitable library is created, you can place the content (HTML and other files) here.It's enough to read only (everyone else), in the case of libraries, the right of run is no price, but you are not your group to read, but you can access the content through the Web.You can access http://users.iit.uni-miskolc.hu/~username or http://www.iit.uni-miskolc.hu/~username.
Why do not you appear on some HTML pages or files on your web page?
Each file must have the right to read the other group.In the case of libraries, run rights are required, and the content can be listed.Without this, if the file name is known, it is possible to achieve its content.To set the files privileges CHMOD -R G + R, O + R PUBLIC_HTML, FIND -TYPE D -EXEC CHMOD A + RW \ {\} \;
How do I know how much space do you take?
In Du, Baobab, Krusader, "Tools" menu item is "Disc User".
What is the mouse on a good character surface?
To facilitate extraction and insertion.The mouse can be used to select the middle button (roller) to insert.And most of the Tui-based programs handle the mouse too.
Why do you not beeping your echo \ a or beep?
Because there is no spider or disabled in BIOS.(The Beep is therefore not installed.)
How do I inform the C functions?
Section 3 is a description of the functions: MAN 3 function name.From this man's man add description, but the name of the man -K function will also print in which it is.The man-function name allows all sections overlapping.
What does the output of the quota command mean?
To do this, it is like writing:
Disk quotas for user teszt (uid 1000):
Filesystem blocks quota limit grace files quota limit grace
192.168.42.1:/home 188100 307200 320000 13992500 2700
192.168.42.1:/mail 52 153600 163840
FileSystem: Disk Attachment Point (For Network Drive IP Address)
Blocks: Number of kilobytes used
Quota: The upper limit of the number of kilobytes used (it must be kept below)
Limit: The upper limit of the number of kilobytes temporarily used (we can use it for a short period of time)
grace: temporarily usability time
files: the number of files
After changing the password, why can not I log in?
Before changing the password, always make sure the keyboard allocation, Capslock and Numlock real - test strips we see, do not see the status of the LEDs. The input of the PASSWD in the terminal also reads the control signals, and in the case of off Numlock, each digit will take over the role of the cursor movement, but you can only log in on a character interface, and graphical interface does not allow them to use them. (Password numbers, letters and punctuation series, ignore TAB, F1, F2, ..., F12, cursoring keys, etc.) Observe that the login screen is using English key allocation. Thus, we avoid using Y or Z in the password or do not forget that it is replaced. The special characters are the one! There is only the same place in the graphical interface (neither on the check-in or from the terminal emulators), the Alt + code is not supported on command interface (0 to 255) Yes. When copying to pendrive or relocated, I received an error, some files were not transcripted. Linux file systems distinguish small and large letters, but the file system of the Pendrive FAT is not. Linux file systems can use any character, exception to the slit (/), but under the pendrive FAT file system. Due to the different storage of the disc, symbolic and hardwoods, these should be taken into account when checking.
On the / kozos and windows machine under the // hera / kozos network drive, I do not see some files or notes.
There are no limits on Linux machines for characters that can be used in file names.On Window file systems, however, we will ignore these on both systems.
How do I find out which machines were I used?
How do I know which machine / TMP or / Tarolo library did I use?
From there, because every machine has its own log.The Herra was not hungry.
How do I refer to machines?
With their names: you want
Do you exist for Virus Linux?
Not really, - can not be excluded, with little number - and its effects the system is not combined.So you can only harm our own files.The virus program running in the Wine program can exert its effect.

A ^ or C is a sign of the CTRL keyboard, x is the x key, so this means that Crtl and X joint (Ctrl + X).No F13 and F36 button numbered button on the keyboard!There is nothing wrong with anyone, F13 and F24 for Shift + F1 and F12;F25 and F36 between Shift + Ctrl.
Confused my terminal what do I do?
Presumably we wrote a binarist file on the screen.Ctrl + L can be used to delete the screen.If this does not help you close or log out.Do not use the CAT command to the annex - only files, instead, Less, More use.And the launch of the launched programs (sdtout, sdterr) to the / dev / null file if it is not necessary.For example: IceWeaSel 2> / dev / null
How can I quit command line text editors?
VI, VIM: ESC: Q!Without Save Esc: X Save Color
Ed: q without saving w q with rescue
Emacs: CTRL + X + C or CTRL + X CTRL + C Query to save and exit
joe:
jed:
MCEDIT: F10 Asks to save and exit
nano, pico: ctrl + x asks for saving and quitting
We give editor and / or visual variables to which we can use it.(Although there is not very installed command to set this.)
English Wikipedia also provides a good description and screen shot of popularity.The description is http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages or http://packages.debian.org/stable/.Whether the http://screenshots.debian.net/, or ???page can also access screenshots.
Where is the command?
What is the contents of one function?
With the DECLARE -F function name command.
How do I know that a command can be used?
By using whatis command name command.
How do I know which command to a (specified) activity is?
By one of the APPOS activity or man -K activity commands.
How do I know the command switches?
With the command name --Help or -K switch, VAHY HELP built-in_ command name and man command name (if this translation can be obsolete) with one of commands.

If you did not create your thesis / diploma work at the General Informatics Department, but you will be closing here because of your chosen specialization, then indicate the design manager to submit your thesis / diploma work to the Administration of the General Informatics Department at the latest one week before the final exam, the external and the inside With criticism!
3. In the event of the final examination - in the case of an attendance exam
One hour before the official start date is the four students who are in the first four places in the scheduling order.Of them (depending on the room), three or four of them are drawn and started to develop them.At the official commencement date, the Commission will be involved and everyday is a student student.The President opens the exam.The seat is public, anyone can stay inside.Then the exam starts.
Ordinary room layout
The final exam consists of two parts: Protection of thesis 1. The student describes its thesis in the form of a pre-prepared presentation before the final exam committee, approx. 6-8 minutes. (The available time is always proposed because it is not too lucky to interrupt the student in the middle of his message and this is the feeling of unfinished!) The presentation is compulsory to which the Projector is provided by the department. Providing a computer used for projecting and pre-uploading the presentations is the task of the examining students. The President of the Final Exam Committee and its members ask questions about the thesis, taking into account the judgment of the thesis. The student must respond to the questions without preparation. Suggestions for Writing Presentation: See below! 2. Oral exam from the items outlined. The full final exam committee will examine the student from the topic issues. The student starts responding on the basis of a drawn item at the request of an examiner. During the exam, you can also contact the examinee from any examiner from any examiner from the batch, but from the entire topic. For a preliminary reconciliation of pull-out items, a minimum of 30 minutes of preparation is available to students. Only one student can examine simultaneously, parallel examination is not possible. An candidate is approx. 30 minutes is available for protection and verbal exam. After you have trained a student and left the room, the following listening batch in the scheduling order will be drawn and start preparing. If all students have trained, the final exam committee holds a closed meeting, discusses and evaluates the performance of the examiners, which is recorded in the form of a Protocol and verifies by signing the entire committee. Then it takes place to describe the results.
Calculating the qualification of the diploma
In case of MSc training:
OP - Operational Course Ticket IK - Ticket DM - Discrete Mathematics Ticket AV - Algorithms and Course Ticket AA = (OP + IK + DM + AV) / 4, averaging average (calculated to two decimals) (eg:(2 + 3 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 2.75) DT - Diploma (eg 5,00) T1 - Ticketing the first examination T2 - the second test ticket VA = (T1 + T2) / 2, the average mark of the exams (calculated to two decimalities) (eg 5 + 4) / 2 = 4.50) Diploma certification: D = (AA * 0.2 + dt * 0.5 + VA * 0.3),Average on the basis of the subsidy average, the diploma and the average of the examaries (eg 2.75 * 0.2 + 5.00 * 0.5 + 4.5 * 0.3) = 4.40), which is associated with a text ratingto be entered.
In the case of BSc training:
MT-mathematicsexaminationUnitsSZ -computingexamUnitsAA=(MT+W) / 2,theexamaverage (twodecimal places, calculated)(For example:(2 + 3) / 2 2.50 =)SzD-Ratedresultingin the artessay(PL: 5,00) T1 - Ticketing the first examination T2 - Ticketing the second examination VA = (T1 + T2) / 2, the average number of tests (calculated to two decimalities) (eg 5 + 4) / 2 = 4.50) Qualification of the diploma: D = (AA * 0.2 + SZD * 0.4 + VA * 0.4), the average of the estate average, the thesis and the average of the examaries (eg 2.5 * 0.2+ 5.00 * 0.4 + 4.5 * 0.4) = 4.30), which is entered by text rating.
In case of traditional training:

Text Qualification: 4.51 - 5.00 - excellent 3.51 to 4.50 - good 2.51 to 3.50 - medium 2.00 - 2.50 - sufficient
Lotions
Students for the final exam - regardless of which year they acquired an absolute, they make a final exam from the item line issued in the current year.The item lines can be found on the Department's website.
Suggestions for writing the presentation
The lecture period should be 6-8 minutes. Style should be restrained, solid, simple. The proposed number of projected students is 10, max: 12. More than one slider can no longer be disclosed in the above-mentioned time frame. Student do not have long texts, rather make a good strong outline, from titles, figures. A slide should be approx. 8-10 rows with a relatively large font size (24-28 depending on font). Do not have any more effects (animation, transition) than needed, do not have sound effects. Presentation should be provided, reading is forbidden! The suggested themes of the performance: Title 1 Title, Designer's Leader (Consultant) name, assignment and workplace. (1 slide) 2. Why did you choose this topic? Highlight the relevance and interesting of the topic, the importance of the problem solved. (1 slide) 3. Description of the tasks to be solved (according to the task specification). That is, what had to be designed, calculated, realized ... (1 slide) 4. Description of the solution, highlighting the many problems that are unprecedented without the consultant, and the extremely interesting parts other than the usual, which are unprecedented in several different ways , persuading this committee that the student has acquainted the topic and has fully mastered the necessary, individually processed knowledge. The Commission classifies this, that is, the organization of organization, self-confident and use of individually processed knowledge. (10-15 slides) 5. Summary: Describe the usefulness, usability and development potential of the thesis. (1 slide) The grammatical control is mandatory! The finished presentation is worthwhile to perform several times in a home or a friendly company and modify depending on the duration of the presentation.
Further to do after the final exam
1. In case of successful protection, ZVB.A clerk exhibits a statement about the defense.2. In the possession of the statement, the text of the dissertation / diploma work shall be filled in to the ME Midra system.(Midra.uni-miskolc.hu) 3. Then you have to walk in person to the library and ask for a certificate of successful uploading.4. This certificate must be delivered to the study group of the faculty because it only issues the diploma in the event of its existence.

Using a virtual machine
Virtual machines running on machines in IIT labs
Basic concepts:
- Host OS: The host operating system, which runs natively on a computer on the physical configuration (which is loaded when the real physical machine is started).
- Guest OS: The guest operating system running on an emulated "physical" configuration (under the Host OS), ie on the virtual machine.
- Virtual machine: an emulated "physical" configuration that a program provides eg.VirtualBox, VMware.
The virtual machine uses the host machine resources to provide an emulated configuration where the resource parameters must be given: CPU / seed number, RAM size, virtual hard drive, 2D, 3D video ram size, USB support, voice control, etc.Depending on the program, a virtual machine is built up from 2 files: configuration file (.vbox) and virtual hard disk file (.vdi).
In IIT labs, VirtualBox 5.1 is installed (on Host OS Windows 10 and Host OS Linux as 18), this ensures running virtual machines.
Available Guest OS Hard Disk Pictures:
- Windows 10 Enterprise 32 és 64 bit 1809 LTSC
- Linux Mint MATE 18 32 bit
Tip: If possible, use 32-bit versions as they have a smaller resource requirement.64-bit versions are used only in special cases (eg 64 bit development)!
Use:
1. Open the VirtualBox, check that the list is in the list if you can start and be ready if not, then check whether there is a Guest OS hard drive (.vdi file for virtual machine) Downloaded.For Windows: C: \ virtual folder for Linux: / Virtual (can be created if necessary!)
2. If you have downloaded .Vdi Jump to Point 3, otherwise they are available at http://vgepek.iit.uni-miskolc.hu/ (from the IIT network only) Guest OS .vdi files.Important!Before downloading in our browser, set up to the C: \ Virtual or A / Virtual folder, otherwise there will be no place in the Home / User folder to download the image and download it!
3. Open VirtualBox, select "New" and create a new virtual machine as appropriate (for Linux the Ubuntu line should be followed).
4. It is recommended to provide 2GB for RAM size.
5. Do not select the new creation of the new "Existing Virtual Hard Drive" option and browse the downloaded disk image (.vdi) and click Create.
6. After the virtual machine is completed, you can start or make a few minor modifications, eg.Number of processors 2 (recommended).We are ready to.
TheIITis not responsiblefor filesstored oneither thehostOSor theGuestOS!Everybody to save your job!
About Guestos:
- Log in with an administrator account!
- Password on Linux: X
- The iit lab is also valid for the GUEST OS.With so many exceptions that the instructor's permission can be installed.
- If a Guest OS is inoperable on a particular virtual machine, delete the .vdi and.vbox file and download it again.
* Do not store large files in the Host OS "Home" / "User" folder because LDAP / domain branch synchronization is delayed or interrupted for stored storage space.Use the C: \ Virtual or / Virtual folder!
Download a hard drive (.Vdi) for virtual machines:
Important!Before downloading in our browser, set up to the C: \ Virtual or A / Virtual folder, otherwise there will be no place in the Home / User folder to download the image and download it!
After downloading, Linux Host OS under Terminal window (Ctrl Alt T) Enter the following command: Chmod 777 /virtual/*.vdi
Windows 10 32 bits (7.9GB) (only works from iit network!)
Windows 10 64 bits (10.5GB) (works only from iit network!)
Linux Like 18 32 bits (6.0 GB) (operates from a iit network only!)
Linux as 18 64 bits (6.69 GB) (operates from a iit network only!)
swDevLinux Mint 18 32 bit (8,08 GB)

IIT services, UNIX
Infocommunication services of the General Department of Informatics
The aim of the document describing the infocommunication services of the General Informatics Institute Department of the University of Miskolc is to assist students - especially first-year students who first contact the Department - in achieving services.However, it is not intended to describe them with a full depth.We have found that new students are not always aware of these opportunities and therefore do not use them.
We are talking about the services of Microsoft Windows systems in another way.
You can find out about accessing database managers and use them at http://www-db.iit.uni-miskolc.hu.
The Applied Informatics Institute Department, the University Informatics Service Center and the University Library of Miskolc can provide computer and internet access and additional services.
User Account (Account) Insurance to access various services
We provide a user account (login name and start-up password) to computers operated with UNIX-like operating systems for Iit.uni-molokc.hu delegated to the General IT Institute Department.
In the IIT range, we provide a user account with the same login name, but another password statement system.
Students in high education (different IT specialist and specialized students) with our department will receive the UNIX account number without submitting an application, "Automatically" on the first practices of our department if you enroll and add our first subjects.In the third semester, you may also require a Windows user account if your subjects are picked up / fulfilled.
During the receipt of the user name and startup password, students must declare that the rules on the infocommunication services of the University of Miskolc and the Department are familiar with links and recommendations and consider them mandatory for themselves.
University of Miskolc may also require a student account number to access the central computer under the supervision of the University Informatics Service Center (User: Computer Center).This account number must be required (filling out a claiming form according to the procedure of the University Company Center).We expect the claim from our IT professional and discouraged students, as they receive tasks for educational purposes.Please allow students to submit applications together (collected and organized) together (collected and organized as a period of timetable groups).The University Informatics Service Center is located on the ground floor of the A / 5 building (near the A / 4 building III.)
Account numbers provided by the General Informatics Department in some cases - at the explicit request of the user or if the account number is not used for a long time period or if it violates the rules on infocommunication services, etc.- We can disable.A re-authorization is made on request if it is approved by the head of department.
The user account is used to use and account for general services (to make statistics, monitoring loads, etc.).The services will be listed below.The personal information for the user account can be used for educational purposes in your educational activity for educational activities.
Login to Linux Clients in the IIT Province
If you want to work with a graphical user interface on a selected machine (local use) (if you are characterized by the login interface, press CTRL + ALT + F7 to switch to a graphical interface), select the language you want to use and a character encoding and window manager.Then log in with the user name and password typing.Selection may only be required at first login, this setting is preserved.If you want to change or have deleted the adjusting file, it is necessary to re-select this.
To use the character interface (shell), Ctrl + Alt + F1 (F1, instead of F2 and F6 can be used) with key combination and can be used to use our login name and password.If necessary with the Ctrl + L command, you can delete / update the screen, even within other programs launched.(You can use the CTRL key to press the Ctrl key in this key combinations in the character interface as well as a command line using the CHVT N (where N: 1 to 7 integer).)
Remote use
Remote computers can be accessed by the SSH protocol (default) TCP port 22.
On Linux machines, the client program may be SSH (this is installed on each computer in the IIT range).The Windows world can be a remote machine client for Putty.The advantage of these is that they do not require installation - even from a USB media - can be quickly used.In addition, tunnelier can also be used for Cygwin if installation is also enabled.
Due to the university central firewall, from the university (from the Internet ") in the IIT province only the Jerry.iit.uni-miskolc.hu machine is available on TCP port 22.Additional computers from the University (within Campus) are available.
From a command line:
SSH This e-mail address is protected against sparkobots.To view it you need to enable Javascript.
obsession
SSH-L User Jerry.iit.uni-miskolc.hu
If the user name is the same:
ssh jerry.iit.uni-miskolc.hu
within the range, the user name (for the previous reason) and the domain name:
ssh jerry
or to access graphical programs:
SSH -X This e-mail address is protected against sparkobots.To view it you need to enable Javascript.
Instead of the machine name, they can be used for their IP address or consolidated shape.
The continuation of the connection must be confirmed at the first login.
Hosting service
We provide 300 MB of storage space for each user's educational materials.An additional 150 MB storage space is available for electronic mail (e-mail).Furthermore, the number of creatible files (including directories) is limited.For individual requests, we can provide larger storage space after weighing.
The reason for fulling of the storage space is usually used to be the cache of the browsers.The setup files for graphical user interfaces can also take a lot of space.Our mailing space can be easily accessed due to spam or leaves containing the large attachment.We regularly check our storage and delete unnecessary files.
To query the current occupation, the quota command can be used.
If you can not log in on a graphical interface, one of the reasons can be the access limit for storage space.In this case, you can log in on a character interface and delete unnecessary files.Andfiletransferapplications (seenext section)canalsobe carried outremotely.
If you need temporarily multiple areas to perform some task, a / tmp list can be used separately for each machine. When we do not need to be deleted to these files. If I do not do this, the / TMP list files are deleted as regular modes (older than 7 days) and every boot. And for this purpose, the file systems under the lab computers are / tarolo and / kozos. The disadvantage of / TMP and / tarolo is that we can only reach the particular (single) machine. If next time we need access, we must log in to the same machine. The content of the / kozos note is also available from each lab computer and computers in the Windows room so you can easily share files between the two systems. A / Tarolo / and / Kozos content is retained for a longer period of time and will not be deleted during booting.
Users' files (storage space): / home and / mail and / kozos content are provided by a service machine via a network file system transparently (not yet noteworthy).This is achieved by signing up for any machine, see the same files to the user.
File transfer service
With FTP protocol, port 21 can provide file transfer service to ftp.iit.uni-miskolc.hu service provider.You can upload files from our client machine to our own file system in the iit domain and download files from the file system of the iit domain to the client file system.
In our Unix-Linux world FTP clients:
The following utilities are: FTP, LFTP, MC, etc.
Windows world FTP clients:
a Total Commander, FlashFXP, IE stb.
Ftp://ftp.iit.uni-miskolc.hu is also available from the university outside.
In the iit Unix-Linux range, you can also use the SSH protocol SCP command:
SCP This e-mail address is under protection against speech.You must enable JavaScript enabled to view.: Something
Electronic mail service
All users also provide mailing address and mailbox (mailbox) for the account number.The form of mail address:
This e-mail address is under protection against spindrobots.To view it you need to enable Javascript.
Incoming letters are checked by spam and virus filter.
Leaves classified as rubbish are not discarded.Subject header The spam text and other header lines are inserted at the beginning of the header.Using this information, the user correspondent agent or other user utility may have the fate of a letter classified as a classified letter.
Viral leaves are cleaned or deleted.
We can access our electronic mailbox in a variety of ways.In the iit Linux world, MUTT, PINE, ICEDOVE, or Mozilla Thunderbird can be used for custom mail agents.
From anywhere we can mail with a web browser with our webmail service:
https://webmail.iit.uni-miskolc.hu 
To query our mailbox, you can use the following protocols from "Outside" on the indicated service providers:
POP3: //POP3.IIT.UNI-Miskolc.HU: 110
POP3S: //POP3.IIT.UNI-Miskolc.HU: 995
Shimp: // I
Mimps: //hap.t.
Iit Linux can be used with individual agents (see fold) without limitation without limitation on the campus without limitation, "external" limitation (by identifying users) with the SMTP protocol on port 25 to our SMTP provider:
smtp://smtp.iit.uni-miskolc.hu:25
We can automatically be forwarded to our mailbox by correctly prescribing the contents of your login list .forward file.Study the provision of the forwarding option.
My Web Page Insurance
All users can create your own web page.You must set up and provide adequate access to a Public_HTML list and make HTML, CGI and PHP files from this beginning.The conventional name of the website can be index.html or index.htm.You can then see a link to the website:
http://www.iit.uni-miskolc.hu/~ UserNev or
http://www.iit.uni-miskolc.hu/~ UserV / index.html
Department Web Services
The Department's website: http://www.iit.uni-miskolc.hu
Mailing list service
Informatics grades, groups may require mailing list service.The mailing list can be added to electronic addresses (sign up and down) users.After recording, the letter sent to the list address will be received by the person recorded by the title of the list.For the list request, you must specify the list administrator, the purpose of the list (subject).The goal (topic) is compatible with the University's objectives.The lists are allowed by the head of department.
The list addresses may be: mailto: // This e-mail address is under protection against speech.To view it you need to enable Javascript.
DNS service
This feature resolves an order for each other's domain names and IP addresses of the zone delegated to their department.Virtually transparent for our users is the name resolution and the primary DNA name solution in our zone a
LDAP service
The service is available in the Data Recognition System (Directory) available with LDAP protocol, especially user account numbers.Users are mostly transparent (eg using the Finger utility), but with the Ldapserach utility you can retrieve directly within the IIT range.The service computer is a
Using Removable Storage in 104th Laboratory
On computers in computer labs, Linux selects optical discs and storage with USB interface storage.The scenario of the Usage consists of the following steps:
CD / DVD / Pendrive / etc.physical insertion / connectivity.
Issuing of the next (MEDIUM corresponding) command ("Attachment"):
MOUNT / CDROM OR MOUNT / PENDRIVE
Make sure that the writing is actually and correctly only caused by a Sync or umount command until they have been issued, do not remove Medium from the drive.
At the end of our work, "Attach" the container:
umount / cdrom or umount / pendrive
And only then remove the disc from the drive, pull out the USB device.Never forget to break up!
PanTrive usage under Linux is interesting because other types of devices can be accessed by a different name.Therefore, it must be checked for what has become the Pendrive ID (eg DMESG) and can be attached to it.
Multimedia options under Linux in laboratories
AUDIO: Audio outputs on the machines can be used with your own headset.Do not use loudspeakers because others can be disturbed.For MP3 playback, XMMS is available.The mixer can be easily handled with the AUMIX program.
Video: To play video files, the MPlayer program can be used, which supports many file formats and compression procedures.You can connect to a full-screen view with the F key, navigate to the cursor motion key and the pagedown / PAGUP pair.
Recommended software under Linux in the laboratory
Graphic user interface
WindowMaker: Small resource needs, Puritan, fast.Due to the relatively small central memory of the laboratory machines, we recommend this use.
BlackBox / Fluxbox: Comfortable and fast.With the BBKEys utility, you can assign key combinations to different commands, making it more efficient with this job.
TWM: The smallest resource graphic interface that is available at the department.It has minimal functionality and design, so it is less recommended.
GNOME: It is less recommended due to a relatively high resource requirement.User-friendly, comfortable.
KDE: MS Windows-like structure makes it easy to use a customized interface, but there is a great resource requirement (largest among these days).For this reason, we do not recommend using it.
Browser
Mozilla Firefox: known browser, starting with the Firefox command.
Galeon is another option to start: Galeon
KDE's built-in browser is Konqueror
Text mode, fast, simple browser for W3M.Text browsers are Lynx / Links / Elinks.
Correspondent clients
MUTT: Fast and comfortable, high-quality text mode correspondence program, although you do not appear to be a user friend at first time.
Pine: a well-known mailing program on UNIX systems.Used in many places at university.
Mozilla-Thunderbird: A graphical surface corresponding to MS Outlook.
Our webmail service was described above.Browser for freemail.hu, mailbox.hu etc.It is a system similar to the mailing system for free service providers.
File manager
The Midnight Commander (start MC) for Norton Commander used in DOS,compares to Dos Navigator.
Office package
Open Office: This is the largest compatibility with MS Office from the free office suite.It is able to export documents to PDF format.Is relatively slow due to the need for a large resource.It also contains a spreadsheet, a simple drawing program and a demonstration maker.
AbiWord: a faster document editor, but not all MS Word documents are handled properly.
Text (TXT) Editor
Nano, Pico: Easy to use, comfortable, easy-to-learn character text editor.Their key combinations are customary.
Joe: Similar to the previous word processor, but with combinations other than usual.
MCEDIT: A word processor similar to the Edit program used in DOS times.
VI, VIM: Unix's classic word processor.Wishing you a different key combinations and sessions other than usual.After a lot of practice it is comfortable.
PDF document reader
Acroread: Adobe Acrobat Reader 8 Linux version.It is relatively slow, but all documents are displayed well.
XPDF: Small resource needs, relatively fast, but in some cases does not show the document properly (eg when using formulas).If Acroread is not justified, it is worth using this.
Development Environments Translators
GNU Compiler Collection: The most common translator in the Linux environment.Capable of translating C, C ++ source programs.The open source programs usually use this to test them.It is recommended to use it.Starting: GCC, G ++
Xemacs, Emacs: A developing environment with many expansion and accessories with unique key combinations.Use initially cumbersome.Starting: Xemacs, Emacs
KDevelop: Graphic development environment that uses the GCC compiler.Start: Kdevelop
Netbeans & J2SDK: Java translating and running suitable for Javac and Java program.TheNetBeans(start:netbeans)graphicaldevelopment environment(writteninjavainitself, sovery highresource-intensive, considertheuseofour machines).

What does duality mean in our training and work?
How can you apply?
Most important information on dual training:
From September 2015, five training areas (technical, information technology, agri, natural science and economic sciences) are departed by dual training.
Dual training is the form of training in the practice-intensive basis in which practical training for professionally qualified companies increases the professional competence, corporate operating knowledge and corporate culture of students in their curriculum content, structure and companies.
With companies, higher education institutions conclude a cooperation agreement for participation in training.
The economic organization and the student won recruitment are entering a student employment: the company is obliged to remunerate the student for the full time of training (so both under the corporate and institutional periods).The amount of the fee shall be 15% of the minimum wage minimum wage (amounting to at least 60% of the minimum wage per month) at least once a week (60% of the minimum wage per month).
Application for dual training forms in the 2015 recruitment procedure consists of two parallel phases: from the state, general recruitment procedure (which is nothing different from non-dual profits) and from a corporate recruitment stage.
In the recruitment prospectus, it will be shown in January in addition to the announced, "traditional" non-dual-shaped experts in a footnote if it also starts in dual form and corporate partners will also be listed.
The applicant submits its application in a general way in a dual form in the public admission procedure.
If you want to win the recording in the dual form, in parallel, you need to contact the recruitment information with one or more corporate partners (or representative) indicated with that particular time.
The company will indicate the availability of its website and details of its own corporate recruitment procedure.
The applicant may participate in the corporate admission procedure as provided for in the company.
The company will inform the applicants by 3 July 2015 at the latest on the outcome of the selection (so whether it complies with the applicant).
The candidate - aware of successful or unsuccessful corporate recruitment procedures - is still time and the possibility of modifying the order of application in the state recruitment procedure within a period of 14 days prior to the date of the classification decision (point drawing).
The unsuccessful enterprise recruitment procedure does not affect the general recruitment procedure, does not affect the results of the point drawing.
In the public admission procedure, after the successful point drawing, the applicant may enroll in the higher education institution in September.If youclosed thecorporaterecruitment processissuccessful(iethe company "picked up"thecandidates),andintends to continuestudies inthe dualform, the lattershall indicateahigher education institutionofenrollment(ie,successfulcorporaterecruitmentdoes not committo anythingthe listenermay decidethat he would rather begin studies in the "traditional" non-dual form).
If during the dual training, the student "wants to stay" from dual training, at any time you can request receipt of "traditional", day-care work.

What does duality mean in training and work?
Training consists of 2 * 24 = 48 weeks per school.Of this, an average of 26 weeks of theoretical and 22 weeks is the time spent on practical training.For IT training, our system will have less corporate practice in our system for the first 2 years (18 years per year), which you must complete during the period after university education.However, in the 5th semester, you will have the opportunity to master the practice at the company every week every week.
The company entails a student employment contract with the student, in which publicity and freedom are recorded.Companies may also advertise freely optional objects for their specialties for students participating in dual training.At the end of the training, it is possible to prepare a thesis for the student that is linked to the research topics of the company.
The income payable on the student's employment contract is governed by law, current minimum amount of minimum wage is 15% per week.This income is tax and contribution-free due to your student's legal relationship.
In the program designer and engineer at IT professionals, 1-4.In the semester we designed 9-9 weeks of practice, of which 6-6 weeks for the exam period, 3-3 weeks fall for the summer period, thus ensuring that theoretical training is received together with normal initial training students.The practical training of the first 4 semester is to be maintained in a group of university laboratory environments but involving corporate professionals.
In the last 2 and 3 semesters (depending on the basis), the exercises will be implemented in corporate training sites within 3 days (Monday-Wednesday), preferably to the real projects of companies.

Introduction
The predecessor of the Academy of Selmecbánya was founded in 1735 under the name Berg-Schola.In 1762 he raised Mary Theresa in 1762.Due to World War I, the school had to move, and education continued in Sopron in spring 1919.The Miskolc University (NME) was set up in 1949, and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering was also formed.
Youth organizations, Student companies in Selmec
Regarding the nationality of the student of Selmec, it was a heterogeneous composition, but it was due to the spirit of the age, but the German element was dominant for custom and language in the whole monarchy.So there is nothing weird that young people who come from the Netherlands - have shaped their habits and nosses based on a German sample and thus become a homogeneous, cohesive corporation of the later academy.
For a few decades following the establishment of Berg-Schola, we can not talk about unified student life, rather I can only resemble these classmates with an unprecedented young cheerful compartment.I'm listening here many times the locals were scared with their rough, violent behavior, their lifestyle and methods.This is not a time shutdown, the end became the end.The lifestyle of student was later solid and turned inward.
The first written evidence provides information on the youth company with "Deutsche Geselschaft Zu Schemnitz" operating from the 1820s.This body represented and assembled the whole of youth.Their gatherings were held in the "Schacht" (mine) pub in the city (Wednesday and Saturday) twice a week (Wednesday and Saturday) while brewing and nosing.In the life of the company, the feeling of belonging to the Academy of Selmeci dominated.Anyone who became a student became a member of the friendship community.
In addition to the organizational youth organization, some of the nation nationalities worked from the beginning, smaller groupings and companies from one country.These are concluded in common language and culture.
For the years 1840, the number of students in Selmecen is swell, creating the greater social weight of students in the life of the city.At that time, the room for the gatherings of academics was addressed to the "Golden Bányécs" (Zum Golden Grubbicht, Head: Stelz Flórián), which operated as a club until the end of the XIX. No. They held a general meeting here, here was the reading room. This wasComprehensive body of youth was called the Academy and chosen officials were directed. It was his own club, library maintenance, balls, parades, balloon, coloring, etc. Organization. Here every student was equal. In addition to a comprehensive companyOther smaller youth movements have lived. Their most significant types of burschenle and the already mentioned national cultural organizations.
In Burschenle, the mulberry-sided, robust students attended.This was the schacht pub for decades.The Company did not have any objective goals, but merely the sense of cohesion in the midst of the ending beer, cínios and sonuses.Consequently, it was not a member of all students;was who did not love beer and pipafeat;There was a person who dedicated his time to his studies, and many academics simply did not even go to the pub.
The Schacht Pub Building has become a symbol of a student life in the midst of cheerful funks (sometimes overcapacity).The members of the company named themselves to "Bursch" (German: Fellow, Copy).In addition to the walls of the pub, no events have been organized, and they have not organized their joint assets.Members here were stratified by the most stringent sign and superiority relationship and only the increase in the number of years spent on the academy could rise upwards.It was a positive one to help and help the brothers and sister love of each other.
In 1852, the Selmeci Hungarian Reader Society was established, the purpose of which was the nursing and cultivation of Hungarian language and literature, for which a rich library was created and held reading evening.(That companyrose tonational fameat the time wasalsoa Lutheranhigh schoolrank ofjointsecondary schoolwas set up.)Butthe Viennesegovernment authoritiesbanned allkind ofnationalliterary societyin 1854.
After the loss of the War of Independence, the Golden Bányécs Café Name and non-policies have remained alive after the prosperous student companies.With the elimination of the number of the German-speaking audience again, the Bursch-type company became the decisive factor.While German-emotional students have stood under the flag of Burschenschaft for the great German ideas, Hungarian, Polish, Italian students have become here for the fight against Habsburg.
In 1858, Schacht Concern (Verbindung Schacht) was formed, which came to the need for compression of the entire audience.Ithas beenheldinthe General Assembly,ledProtocol,issued anewspaper,club,library, etc.operates.
The Academy's youth was all Bursch.The chairman of the Social Circle could be a more prestigious 3rd or 4th-year student who was preferably more tough and he stopped in the breeze, and members of the company lived in the spirit of collegality.
They started to re-enjoy the smaller student organizations of different nationalities.These interconnected Hungarian cultural constraints have considered their aim of creating a single Hungarian Youth Association.
In 1863, the Hungarian self-education and co-focus was established.At this time, Concordia and Casino also develop German cultural economies, which have led to the formation of the Academic Youth Circle later.Until then, many hugs have been added.The first step in developing was the merger of Concordia and the self-literary conversation under General Society (Á.t.).However, this has not yet represented the whole of youth.
The academic reading circle held its general meetings in Ertl's restaurant known as the "grapes" opposite the golden mines since 1871.The purpose of the Company is to: professional self-education, brotherly coexistence and the lure of Hungarian language and habits.Member could be all academics who did not have a member of the Schacht Tara.Members have chosen officials.The general assemblies were opened by the hymn, and after the official reports and readings were recurred.This was followed by dinner, wine and gypsy music.At their events they tried to introduce Hungarian and cultured students.But his struggle against Schacht and the general company failed in the 1870s.(At that time, two-thirds of the academic lists confessed to Schacht.)
Butin 1876,higherpressureSchachtdeclaredthedissolution ofageneral meeting(theHungarian government,according to theFinance MinisterRegulation,a reminderto allstudents in Germanybanned thecustom ofthing.)
Then they founded the united Hungarian company (M.T.).The company retained the glittering ceremony, but he had to fight hard battles for a long time with the general company.Finally, the debate was in 1879 when the Hungarian company and the general company called the United Academic Youth Circle.The company leased a separate apartment for the first time in the Szentháromság square, with a kitchen, reader, dining, etc.had premises.They later bought the headquarters.Over the years, the Company has become strengthened and has become a significant student organization managing the entire audience.
The activity of the youth circle in Sopron
The strength of the youth circles, its authority is solidly based on SELMCEN.This appreciation was based on respect for traditions, the consistent compliance of the rules developed and at the same time adaptation to change and development.The voluntary discipline, the moral and material reliability and the likelihood of confusion were the principles for the magnitude of the circle.For the turn of the century, the youth circle has made decisions recognized and accepted by the Academy for all students and issues.(There was a period of time when the youth field membership was a prerequisite for the continuation of college studies).The circle was not only a major factor in the circles of the student, but in the life of the city, there was a significant factor there.
This emphasis and the need for student management and co-operation was also transferred to the circle of Sopron after World War I.Although there were still difficulties in the initiation of education, but the circle continued to supervise the students of the students that today were instituted by several organizations and committees (hök, Döb, ...) at our university, and provided the possibility of culture and culture and all the endHe was watching over the Selmeci student's traditions.In addition, they have other organizational tasks and have a great impact on the life of the city (referendum, volksbund movement).
The youth circle survived the II.World War II also managed to reorganize, but it was no longer in the new system.On May 11, 1948, the dean of the arm (fulfilling the higher instructions) announced the termination of youth age.
After that, Communist organizations have taken over the manager's role above youth (MTESZ, KIS) which have been forbidden by all the traditions "Selmeci traditions". This is the possibility of resuscitation of other companies. For decades, the Selmeci student life has been illustrated. Many times in the industryStudents received the students with the traditions, and they also assume the risk of banning from university.
Student companies in today
After the previous forty years, only a few small-student companies have been re-established since the change of regime, which have aimed at revitalizing and healing and healing and lying on this basis of the "Selmeci student tours", unfortunately today. Most of these are a small number of friendly companies,What many times are organized only on one occasion and are not long-lived. They often do not even get along with the company's creation.
There are, of course, more firm organizations that have been operating for several years, but none as a legally registered association.These are organized by other events (eg balls, quizzes, student days, etc.), as well as their membership regularly and discussed with student-related issues.The members have uniforms to which the company's embroidered spot is sewered.Most companies choose a burnnot, which feels and singing.
Today, Many other university organizations manage students' affairs (scholarship, sports, student representation, ...), so it is likely that there is no longer a student organization that would be able to overcome the whole of our audience in the descending schools.He would gain importance as the youth circle at the beginning of the century.
We would like to list some of the students working today without the need for completeness.

History:
The department was founded in 1989, together with the Institute of Informatics, as the Department of Informatics. In 1995, at the same time as the Department of Applied Informatics was established, the department was renamed the Department of General Informatics. Until June 2007, the head of the department dr. It was Dénes Vadász, then the head of the department was dr. László Kovács took over.
The basic reason for the establishment of the department coincided with the reason for founding the Institute: an organizational framework had to be created for the introduction and deepening of the knowledge of IT sciences in the curricula of various undergraduate and postgraduate courses.
Our department is currently in charge of the outgoing university-level technical informatics department and includes the S8 application development specialization. We have significant subjects in the curriculum of the decommissioning college-level programming mathematics program, the university-level economics programming mathematics program, and the university-level technical manager program.
In the three computer science (engineering, economics and programming IT) courses of the BSc program, we teach the key subjects of the IT core material, and we also play a significant role in the accredited engineering and planned business computer science master's programs.
The computer science engineering consists of 7 semesters
